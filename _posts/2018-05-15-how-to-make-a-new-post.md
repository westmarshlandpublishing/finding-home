## How to make a new post

- go to https://prose.io/#westmarshlandpublishing/finding-home/new/master/_drafts
- select new file
- update the filename to match this pattern YYY-MM-DD-Title-of-your-post.md
- update your content, using the help below.

- click the eyeball, to the right, to preview.
- click the metadata, to the right, and add:
  - layout: post
  - title: The title of your new blog post

- click the disk, to the right, to save.
  - a screen will pop up to allow you to review your changes.
    - if they are good, then click the box to the right of the preview that says "commit"
      - you can add a comment in the box before you click commit if you want to add some notes for future reference. (such as what did you change, are there things you need to follow up on, etc.)


The new post is now saved in the **_drafts** folder.

After you have finished making all your changes, on the toolbare above, click in the **Draft to Post** text (it is basically a button)
  - It will move the post from **_drafts** to **_posts** it will not yet be published out to the world to see, one more step.
